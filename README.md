# Snake-Game-Bot
Using a basic neural network to play the snake game for me.

With PyTorch installed, download the three .py files and run SnakeBot.py.

Current state of the project:
Snake moves towards the food and generally survives, but does so in a convoluted way.
Currently working on:
Overtraining usually makes the snake run in a circle. Planning to give more valuable input, and tweaking the model structure to train more effectively.
