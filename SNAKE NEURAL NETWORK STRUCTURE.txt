SNAKE NEURAL NETWORK STRUCTURE

DEFINITIONS:
S = Number of test cases
N = Number of neurons in the hidden layer

INPUT LAYER: S x 4

WEIGHTS: For each neuron: 4 Weights. 
4 x N total weights

INPUT DOT WEIGHTS: S x N Matrix

HIDDEN LAYER: N neurons

WEIGHTS2: For each neuron, there is 1 weight mapped to the output. So there are N total weights.
^ May change to 2 weights per neuron
